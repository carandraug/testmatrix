Test Matrix Toolbox
===================

This is latest release of the discontinued Test Matrix Toolbox by
[Nicholas J. Higham](http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~higham/).
From the Matrix Computation Toolbox documentation:

> The Test Matrix Toolbox (last release, 1995) has been superseded by the The
> Matrix Computation Toolbox (first release, 2002).
>
> Most of the test matrices in Test Matrix Toolbox have been incorporated into
> MATLAB in the gallery function. The new toolbox incorporates some of the other
> routines in the Test Matrix Toolbox (in some cases renamed) and adds several
> new ones.

I will be using the original Higham's work as basis for implementing missing
functions in [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). While the
original Test Matrix Toolbox was distributed without a license, I received
permission from Professor Higham to use it under the GNU General Public
License version 3 or later:

**Note**: I do not claim authorship of this, all respect is due to Professor
Nicholas Higham, I am simply making small adjustments in order to be included
in GNU Octave.
